# Augmenting_Annotations

Run Augmentations_of_Annotations.ipynb in the main folder

The code is written with comments


I have created 6 folders (high_train_dir, high_test_dir, mid_train_dir, mid_test_dir, low_train_dir, low_test_dir) manually to save the updated annotations there,  with the help of two testing and training text files and previous annotations
